explanation: |
    "This module implements a general likelihood of tomographic 2-point measuremnts
    of various quantities, including galaxy density, cosmic shear, intrinsic alignments,
    CMB lensing, and the various cross powers between these.

    Since this is a very general problem and there are a great many different configurations
    of such data, this module relies on data being in the self-describing format that 
    is discussed here: https://github.com/joezuntz/2point/
    This format attempts to unambiguously describe the various aspects of a tomographic
    two-point measurement to the point where its likelhood can be generated automatically.

    This module looks up theory measurements in specific sections depending what kind
    of measurement is used. To add more data types to the file please see type_table.txt.

params:
    data_file:
        meaning: Filename of the 2pt format FITS file to use.
        type: str
        default:
    data_sets:
        meaning: Space-separated list of which data sets from within
            the file to use for likelihoods.
        type: str
        default: all
    covmat_name:
        meaning: Name of the covariance matrix extension to use
            in the data file.
        type: str
        default: COVMAT
    angle_range_{dataset}_{i}_{j}:
        meaning: Pair of real numbers. If set, for the given data set and pair of
            bins, cut down the data used to this angular range  (min and max)
        type: str
        default:
    cut_{dataset}:
        meaning: Space-separated list of i,j pairs. (no spaces within the pair, just
            betwen them, e.g. cut_lss = 1,2  1,1  3,4.  Remove this bin from the likelihood.
        type: str
        default:
    covariance_realizations:
        meaning: If >0, assume that the Covariance matrix was estimated from a set
            of MC simulations and should thus have the Anderson-Hartlap factor applied
            to increase its size. If zero, assume infinite number of realizations.
        type: int
        default: -1
    sellentin:
        meaning: If set, use the Sellentin-Heavens 2016 change to the likelihood to
            account for this distribution of the covariance estimates. This changes
            the likelihood to a student's-t form. Note that this invalidates the simulated
            data sets used for the ABC sampler.

    like_name:
        meaning: The name of the likelihood to save.
        type: str
        default: 2pt
    likelihood_only:

        type: bool
        default: false
    kind:
        meaning: The interpolation to do into the theory splines.
            See scipy.interpolate.interp1d.

            meaning: If a Fourier-space measurement is used, the angular wave-number
                of the predicted theory curves.  The name of the section here depends on the data type used from

                predictions for this value. For example, C_ell or xi(theta)
